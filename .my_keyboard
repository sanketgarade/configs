! vim like navigation system wide
! Caps_Lock + h,j,k,l = left,down,up,right
! https://shellhell.wordpress.com/2012/01/31/hello-world/

! The detailed explanation of the code:
! 
! 1. The word keysym at the beginning of the line means that a next word should be interpreted by xmodmap as the “name” of the key. The word keycode means that it should be interpreted as it’s “numerical id” produced by a keyboard. Keycodes and keysyms for your keyboard can be checked using the xev utility.
! 2. Lines 2-4 deactivate the ‘Caps_Lock’ function entirely, lines 6-7 bind ‘Mode_Switch’ to the ‘Caps_Lock’ key.
! 3. You should check a keycode for the ‘Caps_Lock’ key on your keyboard with xev utility (see above).
! 4. Next lines change bindings for home row keys.
! 5. We change the third and forth column (after ‘=’) to make sure we create “alternative layout” (the one accessed with “Mode_switch” or “Shift-Mode_switch”), rather than modify layouts accessed without any modifier (1st column), with Shift (2nd column), AltGr (5th column) or Shift-AltGr (6th column)
! 6. Each line binds one of the keysyms “Up, Down, Left, Right” to an appropriate key.
! 7. The rest of each line is there to keep my default bindings intact.

! remove Caps Lock
clear lock
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
remove Shift = Caps_Lock
! add Mode_switch
keycode 66 = NoSymbol NoSymbol
keycode 66 = Mode_switch

keysym h = h H Left NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol
keysym j = j J Down NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol
keysym k = k K Up NoSymbol NoSymbol NoSymbol
keysym l = l L Right NoSymbol lstroke Lstroke

! TODO - what is lstroke and Lstroke?
