fetch PR -
# git fetch origin refs/pull/ID/merge:BRANCHNAME

**** alias ****
alias should look like - 

# fetchpr = '!f() { git fetch origin refs/pull/$1/merge:$2 ; }; f'
where -
$1 = PR ID
$2 = new branch name for this PR

IMP - use single quotes when making the alias, not double quotes.

then run - 
# git fetchpr 33 pr33

This will create new branch called pr33 which has the PR #33

checkout PR - 
# git checkout BRANCHNAME
